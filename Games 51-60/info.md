ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

Each of these exercises builds practical front-end development instincts.
Youâ€™ll understand not just what the code does, but why it works â€” a mindset that separates a casual coder from a confident developer.

Youâ€™ll learn to:

Use the Canvas 2D context for drawing, movement, and collisions.

Manage game loops with requestAnimationFrame for smooth visuals.

Handle keyboard, mouse, and pointer events for interactive input.

Use AudioContext for generating tones and creating responsive feedback.

Apply state machines and modular logic to control game flow.

Balance DOM and Canvas layers effectively for hybrid interfaces.
